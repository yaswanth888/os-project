/*There are 3 student processes and 1 teacher process.Students are supposed to do their assignments and they need 3 things for that pen, 
paper and question paper. The teacher has an infinite supply of all the three things. One students has pen,an other has paper and 
another has question paper. The teacher places two things on a shared table and the student having the third complementary thing makes 
the assignment and tells the teacher on completion. The teacher then places another two things out of the three and again the student 
having the third thing makes the assignment and tells the teacher on completion. This cycle continues. WAP to synchronize the teacher 
and the students*/
